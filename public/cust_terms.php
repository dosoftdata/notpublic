   <p>By using the System and/or the Site you, the User, agree to be bound by the terms of this Agreement with FREIGHT meta PTY LTD ????? ("FREIGHT meta").
   </p>
   <h2>1. Definitions</h2>
   <p>In this Agreement the following terms have the following meanings:

User Eligibility</h2><p>The User acknowledges and agrees that the System is available only to persons aged 18 years old and over. User represents and warrants that he/she is 18 years old or over. If you use the Site and System as a business entity, you represent that you have authority to bind the entity to this Agreement.</p><h2>3. How the System Works</h2><p>3.1 The System operates as both a finder and facilitator metaing to match the needs of Users with Providers. The System and Site acts as a forum for Users and Providers to bid and agree on prices and enter into agreements regarding the provision of freight services by the Provider. Users may choose a Provider on the basis of price or one or more other factors. FREIGHT meta is as a neutral facilitator and the User acknowledges and agrees FREIGHT meta is not directly involved in the transactions and arrangements between Users and Providers. Such transactions and arrangements with Providers will be subject to the Provider's own terms and conditions (if any).</p><p>3.2 The User acknowledges that FREIGHT meta will not (absent special circumstances) reveal the identity and details of any Provider to a User prior to the time of entry of an agreement with a Provider for a Job, such identity to be revealed only upon (or just prior to) the entry of an agreement with that Provider for a Job.</p><h2>4. Fees</h2><p>4.1 The site is free to use for Users. When the user accepts a quote, a Deposit Fee (between 7% and 10% of bid amount) is payable. The Deposit Fee is deducted from balance payable to the Provider. Remaining balance of payment is made directly to Provider as set out under the Provider's Terms and Conditions.</p><h2>5. Cancellations</h2><p>5.1 Users and Providers can cancel a job prior to completion. When a Cancellation Request is made the other party is notified and asked to respond by either agreeing or disagreeing with the reason for the Cancellation Request. If the other party does not respond to the Cancellation Request within 48 hours, the cancellation reason will be automatically accepted and the Job cancelled.</p><p>5.2 If the Provider can not fulfil the job as per the agreement with the User and the User is not at fault then the User is entitled to a full refund of the Deposit Fee. If the User is at fault or there is disagreement over the cancellation reason then FREIGHT meta will review the cancellation reasons provided and make a judgment as to whether a refund of the Deposit Fee will be provided to the User. It is completely at the discretion of FREIGHT meta as to whether the User is at fault or not, and whether the User is entitled to a refund of their Deposit Fee.</p><h2>6.
